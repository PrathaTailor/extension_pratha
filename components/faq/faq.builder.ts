          question:
            'If I file for an extension, am I still required to pay my tax now?',
          answer:
            '<p>Yes, an extension of time to file your return does not grant you any extension of time to pay your tax liability. To find the best way to make a payment for you, visit <a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.irs.gov/payments</a></p>',

          question: `What does it mean that you're an Authorized IRS e- file Provider?`,
          answer:
            '<p>Tax professionals accepted by the IRS into its electronic filing program are called &quit;Authorized IRS e-File Providers.&quit; Each year, we are required to complete testing with the IRS to ensure that our software is operating properly and securely.</p>',

          question: `Do I need to file an extension if I'm expecting a refund?`,
          answer:
            '<p>The IRS and most states require that you file either your tax return or for a tax extension regardless of whether you owe taxes or not. However, there are no additional fees, penalties, or interest charges due on a refund tax return filed after the April 18th personal deadline.</p>',
        },
        {
          question:
            'How do you keep me informed as the status of my extension?',
          answer: `<p>We will email you through each step of the process when you file for a tax extension with us. In the event you don't find an email from us, it's important that you check your spam mail folder. Alternatively, you can always just log back into your account to check on the status of your extension.</p>`,
        },
        {
          question:
            'What if I file an extension and then decide later to file my tax return on time?',
          answer: `<p>Filing for an extension increases the amount of time you have to file your tax return but it doesn't require that you file after the deadline.Theoretically, you could file a tax extension and then file your tax return minutes later without issue.</p>`,
        },
        {
          question:
            'Can I submit my taxes on the due date despite filing for an extension?',
          answer:
            '<p>Yes, you can choose to file your taxes by the original tax deadline. In that case, the IRS will simply ignore the extension of time requested.</p>',
        },
        {
          question: 'What information do I need to file for a tax extension?',
          answer: `<p>Our process guides you through what information you need to file for your tax extension. You will need basic personal information (name, address, Social Security Number) and in the event you are planning to make a payment with your extension, it's possible you'll need some taxable income information. It's also helpful to have your previous year's tax return on-hand during the extension request process. If you find yourself needing to track down some information to complete your extension, our system automatically saves whatever data you've already enetered so you can easily come back to complete the process.</p>`,
        },
        {
          question:
            'Will I also receive an extension from my State, in addition to my federal tax extension?',
          answer:
            '<p> The short answer is, that depends. There are a number of states that grant automatic extensions upon approval of your federal extension while other states require that you file a form directly with them.

          question: 'Do I need to qualify for a tax extension?',
          answer: `<p>There are no IRS requirements for taxpayers to be eligible to file for an income tax extension. The IRS doesn't even require you to give a reason for wanting the extension.That said, all tax extensions must be approved and accepted by the IRS.The IRS matches the information submitted with the extension and compares that information with what they have on file for you.The vast majority of rejections are due to taxpayers submitting data that doesn't match up to IRS records so please be thoughtful when entering your information.</p>`,

        },
        {
          question:
            'Do I have to file a separate tax extension for business and personal needs?',
          answer: `<p>Yes. The IRS generally requires different tax extension applications for personal extensions and business extensions. The exception is for single member LLC businesses. If you own a single member LLC, then you can file a personal income tax extension (Form 4868) which will extend both your personal and business tax deadline.</p>`,
        },
        {
          question: `Does the IRS need to know why I'm filing an extension?`,
          answer: `<p>No! This is one of the most common misconceptions about tax extensions. The IRS will grant you a six-month extension, no questions asked, as long as you fill out the correct form on time (that's Form 4868 for individual income tax extensions, and Form 7004 for businesses).</p>`,
        },
        {
          question:
            'Should I make a tax payment when I file my income tax extension?',

You can resubmit your application as many times as necessary at no additional charge. However, we do not provide refund once the application is processed.</p>`,
        },
        {
          question:
            'What is the late payment penalty if I do not pay any outstanding tax balance when I file my tax extension?',
          answer: `<p>The IRS' late payment penalty is 0.5% of the taxes not paid, charged per month, up to a maximum of 25%. For example, if you have $2,000 of unpaid taxes, the IRS may charge you $10 per month as a late payment penalty.</p>`,

            'I just filed for a federal extension but cannot pay any of my tax liability â€“ what happens now?',
          answer: `<p>The good news is that as long as your federal extension is approved, you will avoid the costly late filing penalty. However, since you are unable to pay your tax liability, you may charged interest on the amount you owe, which is generally charged at rate of 3%-5% per year. You will be able to calculate any interest owed when you file your final tax return.</p>`,

          answer: `<p>"If, on the regular due date of your return, you are "out of the country" and are a U.S. citizen or resident, you are allowed 2 extra months to file your return and pay any amount due without requesting an extension. For a calendar year return, this is June 15, <script>currentYear();</script>. File Form 4868 and be sure to check the box on line 8 if you need an additional 4 months to file your return. "Out of the country" means: 1. You live outside the United States and Puerto Rico and your main place of work is outside the United States and Puerto Rico, or 2. You are in military or naval service outside the United States and Puerto Rico. If you qualify as being "out of the country", you will still be eligible for the extension even if you are physically present in the United States or Puerto Rico on the regular due date of the return. "</p>`,

        {
          question: 'What if I Missed the Deadline for a Tax Extension?',
          answer: `<p>If you have missed the deadline for an extension and still haven't completed your taxes, do them ASAP! This will help minimize IRS penalties and interest owed. Remember, if you owed taxes, the money was due to the IRS by April 15th. Even if you can only send in a partial payment, that will help reduce the amount of penalties and interest you owe.</p>`,
        },
        {
          question: `What if I don't get a confirmation email before the deadline?`,
          answer: `<p>As long as your Electronic Postmark Timestamp above is before the deadline in your timezone, your extension will not be considered late, even if it takes a long time to submit or to be acknowledged.</p>`,
        },
        {
          question: `What if there's an error in my submission?`,
          answer: `<p>" When the Internal Revenue Service Acknowledges your submitted Application, they may reject it because it contains errors. If these errors can be corrected, you may VISIT OUR SITE and re-submit your information. As long as you re-submit your application within FIVE CALENDAR DAYS of the rejection, your Electronic Postmark Timestamp will be the same, and, if accepted, your Application will be on time, even if it was re-submitted after the April 18th Deadline. Some errors can't be corrected - usually if there's a problem with your Taxpayer Identification Number, or if an application or return has already been accepted for your Taxpayer Identification Number. In these cases, we recommend that you contact your local Internal Revenue Service Office - <a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-your-local-irs-office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.irs.gov/help/contact-your-local-irs-office</a>.
